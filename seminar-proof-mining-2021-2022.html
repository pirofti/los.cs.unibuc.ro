<p>Proof mining is a paradigm of research, concerned with the extraction of hidden finitary 
and combinatorial content from proofs that make use of highly infinitary principles. The new 
information is obtained after a logical analysis, using proof-theoretic tools, and can be both 
of a quantitative nature, such as algorithms and effective bounds, as well as of a qualitative 
nature, such as uniformities in the bounds or weakening the premises.
The seminar presents recent results on proof mining. </p>

Recent Applications of Proof Mining in Optimization and Ergodic Theory
<br><br>
Abstract: We will give a brief introduction to proof mining and then discuss
some new devlopments both on the logical side (with N. Pischke)
as well as w.r.t. recent case studies. The latter concern linear
rates of convergence for Tikhonov regularization methods (with
H. Cheval and L. Leustean) and rates of asymptotic regularity and
metastability for nonlinear ergodic theorems in uniformly convex
Banach spaces (with A. Freund).

Proof mining for maximally monotone set-valued operators
<br><br>
Abstract:  I discuss how proofs involving set-valued operators and their 
resolvents can be treated in higher-type arithmetic while attaining 
logical bound extraction theorems. In particular, I focus on a specific 
class of so-called ``maximally monotone" operators which are ubiquitous 
in the literature. In that context, I discuss how one can circumvent the 
logically complicated maximality statement by utilizing Minty's theorem, 
a fundamental result from monotone operator theory, and still obtain 
mathematically strong systems which allow for the explanation of most of 
the previous case studies involving said operators. This leads to a 
surprising and robust connection between the maximality statement and 
formal extensionality of the operator which I discuss in conjunction 
with various quantitative forms of (fragments of) the extensionality 
(viz. maximality) statement which can still be used in the context of 
the previously mentioned bound extraction theorems.

The alternating Halpern-Mann iteration 
<br><br>
Abstract:  The Halpern and Krasnoselskii-Mann iterations are two important methods for approximating 
zeros of nonexpansive maps. Several proof mining results have focused on the study on these iterative 
schemas and variants thereof. Recently [1], together with Bruno Dinis, the alternating Halpern-Mann 
iteration (HM) was introduced for approximating common fixed points of two nonexpansive maps. 
As the name suggests, this method alternates between the Halpern and Krasnoselskii-Mann definitions. 
Under some conditions, it was possible to establish asymptotic regularity and strong convergence towards 
a common fixed point, in the setting of CAT(0) spaces.
In this talk, we will look at the motivations behind this iteration, and discuss how such a strong 
convergence result was made possible by techniques and ideas from the proof mining program ([2]).
In recent work [3], together with Laurențiu Leuștean, it was possible to generalize the asymptotic 
regularity result to UCW-hyperbolic spaces. We will discuss how this suggests that HM is a proper 
mixing of the Halpern and Mann iterations.

On the Borel-Cantelli Lemmas, the Erdős–Rényi Theorem, and the Kochen-Stone Theorem
<br><br>
Abstract:  In this talk we present a quantitative analysis of the first and second Borel-Cantelli 
Lemmas and of two of their generalizations: the Erdős–Rényi Theorem, and the Kochen-Stone Theorem. 
We will see that the first three results have direct quantitative formulations, giving an 
explicit relationship between quantitative formulations of the assumptions and the conclusion. 
For the Kochen-Stone theorem, however, we can show that the numerical bounds of a direct 
quantitative formulation are not computable in general. Nonetheless, we obtain a quantitative 
formulation of the Kochen-Stone Theorem using Tao's notion of metastability.
