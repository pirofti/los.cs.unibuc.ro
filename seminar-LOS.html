Dictionary Learning Heuristics Control Through Adaptive Strategies and Applications to Anomaly Detection
<br><br>
Abstract: Dictionary learning has two model-dependent heuristics: sparsity level and dictionary size. 
Both are highly dependent on the signals and there are few applications in which an informed, 
accurate choice is possible. Particular problems, such as classification, entail further parameters 
that interfere with learning.
We present several adaptive strategies that are aimed at finding the optimal values for these 
heuristics or at avoiding the choice altogether.
We also discuss the implications on anomaly detection, which we treat as a special case of classification.

Anomaly Detection ABC
<br><br>
Abstract: We briefly revisit and discuss the standard methods for anomaly detection, such as 
One Class SVM, SVDD, Isolation Forrest, and Gaussian Mixtures. For each method we analyze the 
optimization problem, its anomaly detection applications, and the improvements gained by introducing 
non-linear transformations to the inputs via kernel methods (connecting the anomaly detection field to Hilbert spaces).

Inexact Proximal Point Algorithm for Convex Optimization under Holderian Growth
<br><br>
Abstract: Proximal Point Algorithm (PPA) gained a long-lasting attraction
for both abstract operator theory and numerical optimization communities. Even in modern applications,
researchers still use proximal minimization theory to design scalable algorithms that
overcome nonsmoothness. Remarkable works established tight relations between the convergence behaviour of PPA and the regularity
of the objective function. In this talk we present nonasymptotic iteration complexity of
exact and inexact PPA to minimize convex functions under Holderian growth. In particular, we recover well-known results on PPA: finite
convergence for sharp minima and linear convergence for quadratic growth, even under presence
of inexactness. However, without taking into account the concrete computational effort paid for
computing each PPA iteration, any iteration complexity remains abstract and purely informative.
Therefore, based on an inner (proximal) gradient/subgradient method subroutine that computes inexact
PPA iteration, we secondly present computational complexity bounds of a restarted inexact
PPA, that are available when no information on the growth of the objective function is known.

Low-level Attacks and Software Mitigations on RISC-V
<br><br>
Abstract: 
RISC-V is a modern open-source architecture developed in 2013 at the University of Berkeley. 
It maintains the old features of the classic RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architectures, 
but tries to remove the vulnerabilities discovered in the past years. In this context, the 
main goal of RISC-V is to evolve without compromise, improving the performance of the chips 
only if this is done completely safely. In this context, we introduce some of the most popular 
attacks like Buffer Overflow, ROP and we present some variants of Spectre, a famous family of 
attacks reproduced on a speculative RISC-V core named BOOM. We also present a software mitigation 
for one of these variants and other future directions.

Quadratic rates of asymptotic regularity for the Tikhonov-Mann iteration
<br><br>
Abstract: 
We compute quadratic rates of asymptotic regularity for the Tikhonov-Mann iteration in W-hyperbolic spaces. 
This iteration is an extension to a nonlinear setting of the modified Mann iteration defined recently by Bot, 
Csetnek and Meier in Hilbert spaces. We obtain these quantitative results by applying methods from proof mining. <br>
This is joint work with Lauren&#539;iu Leu&#537;tean.

Matching Logic: The Foundation of the K Framework
<br><br>
Abstract: The <a href="https://kframework.org">K framework</a> is an effort in realizing the ideal language
framework, where programming languages must have formal semantics and all
language tools are automatically generated from the formal semantics.
Until recently, K has been developed as an engineering endeavor driven by
challenges such as formalizing the complete semantics of large languages
(C, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc), but deriving its semantics from
translations to various formalisms, such as rewriting logic, graph
transformations, or Coq.  This semantics borrowing approach came not only at
a notational cost, where the original language meaning was
``lost in translation'', but also at a foundational cost: the target
formalisms were more complicated than necessary, yet more restricted due to
their prescribed ways to define language semantics.
<br>
In this talk I will present matching logic as the new and direct foundation
of K.  I will also discuss some of its applications in defining constructors,
transition systems, modal mu-logic and temporal logic variants, reachability
logic and thus Hoare logics, and separation-logic-style recursive predicates
and patterns.  Matching logic can therefore be regarded as an expressive
foundation for programming languages, and K as a best effort implementation.
An appealing aspect of matching logic's Hilbert-style proof system is that
it admits a small proof checker, in the order of 200 LOC including parsing.

The mysterious case of a waning algebraic specification
<br><br>
Abstract: Join me in a brief foray into algebraic specification. We'll first look at the 
recent and not so recent history of a field that has had a tremendous impact on several areas 
in mathematical logic and formal software development. Although it is no longer as actively 
studied as it used to be, algebraic specification continues to foster new ideas in fields 
such as artificial intelligence and formal methods. I will share with you the reason why I 
am doing research in this field, how my work fits into the landscape of formal specification 
and verification, and some ongoing and future research efforts.

Analysis of executables: Designing an emulator a decade ago
<br><br>
Abstract: In my past life I’ve been researching the field of dynamic analysis in regards to
emulating obfuscated and/or malevolent binaries. The result was an emulator that translates
code blocks of binary samples from different platforms (operating systems and machine types)
into an intermediate representation where information retrieval, data analysis and behaviour
observations are made.

Certifying Findel derivatives for blockchain
<br><br>
Abstract: Findel is a composable DSL for financial derivatives that can be executed on the blockchain. 
The language is simple and expressive enough to express complex derivatives. However, compared to 
its competitors, Findel does not guarantee that contracts progress properly. There is no default 
refund mechanism, and the economic enforcement is not handled by the language itself. Given 
the immutability of the blockchain, more caution should be taken in order to avoid undesired situations.
In this presentation, we address the formal verification of financial derivatives written in Findel. 
We define a formal semantics of Findel in Coq and we test it against the existing Findel test suite. 
We enrich our semantics with means to interactively formalise and prove properties about Findel contracts. 
The goal is to avoid mistakes in Findel contracts that may have a negative impact (e.g., 
stuck contract executions, money losses). The derived infrastructure is used to certify non-trivial 
contract examples that cover the most common types of derivatives (forwards/futures, swaps, options).<br><br>

A mixed-integer MPC with polyhedral potential field cost for collision avoidance
<br><br>
Abstract: This work pertains to the use of polyhedral potential fields which take into account 
the obstacles' shape through their associated sum function. As contributions, we extend the polyhedral 
sum function notion to the multi-obstacle case and show that the polyhedral support of its 
piecewise affine representation comes from an associated hyperplane arrangement. We exploit 
the obtained combinatorial structure to provide equivalent mixed-integer representations and 
model a repulsive potential term for subsequent use in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation. 
The advantages are related to a decrease in the computational complexity and a coherent description 
of the repulsive potential, regardless of the cluttered environment's complexity.

Self-Supervised Learning in Multi-Task Graphs through Iterative Consensus Shift
<br><br>
Abstract: The human ability to synchronize the feedback from all their senses inspired recent 
works in multi-task and multi-modal learning. While these works rely on expensive supervision, 
our multi-task graph requires only pseudo-labels from expert models. Every graph node represents 
a task, and each edge learns between tasks transformations. Once initialized, the graph learns 
self-supervised, based on a novel consensus shift algorithm that intelligently exploits the 
agreement between graph pathways to generate new pseudo-labels for the next learning cycle. 
We demonstrate significant improvement from one unsupervised learning iteration to the next, 
outperforming related recent methods in extensive multi-task learning experiments on two challenging datasets.

A general overview of the K Framework's symbolic execution engine
<br><br>
Abstract: One of the main tools offered by the K Framework is its symbolic execution engine, 
which allows one to automatically prove program specifications. This presentation will go over 
the internal language of the prover and how it relates to matching logic, how the prover interprets 
this language and attempts to satisfy reachability claims. The goal of this presentation is 
to bridge the gap between K definitions and specifications and what happens behind the scenes 
when one executes the K prover.

From local to global consistency in distributed monitoring of Petri Net models
<br><br>
Abstract: In this technical note we consider a distributed analysis of a plant given by local 
Petri Net models (components) that interact via shared transitions. For each component, there 
is a local agent that performs local calculations and exchanges information with its neighbours 
for monitoring the plant. We relax the standard requirement that the interaction graph between 
components is a tree and, for the general case, we investigate under which conditions the local 
consistency of the local estimates implies their global consistency. Moreover, we show that 
if the information exchanged between agents incorporates additional information related to 
the execution time intervals of the shared transitions, the globally consistent estimates 
become equal to the results derived in a centralized setting.
