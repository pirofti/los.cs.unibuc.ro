Proof mining and applications in nonlinear analysis and convex optimization
<br><br>
Abstract: The research program of proof mining is concerned with the extraction of hidden finitary content 
from proofs that make use of highly infinitary principles. The new information is obtained 
after a logical analysis, using proof-theoretic tools, and can be both of quantitative nature, 
such as algorithms and effective bounds, as well as of qualitative nature, such as uniformities 
in the bounds or weakening the premises. Thus, even if one is not particularly interested in 
the numerical details of the bounds themselves, in many cases such explicit bounds immediately 
show the independence of the quantity in question from certain input data. This line of research, 
developed by Ulrich Kohlenbach in the 1990's, has its roots in Georg Kreisel's program on 
unwinding of proofs, put forward in the 1950's. Proof mining can be related to Terence Tao's 
proposal of hard analysis, based on finitary arguments, instead of the infinitary ones from soft analysis.
In this talk we give an introduction to proof mining and present some recent applications in 
nonlinear analysis and convex optimization.

On abstract proximal point algorithms and related concepts
<br><br>
Abstract: The proximal point algorithm is a fundamental tool of convex optimization, traditionally 
attributed to Martinet [1], Rockafellar [2] (who named it) and Br&eacute;zis and Lions [3]. In its many 
variants, it usually operates by iterating on a starting point a sequence of mappings dubbed 
``resolvents", whose fixed points coincide with the solutions of the optimization problem that 
one is aiming at. It has been observed by Eckstein [4] that the arguments used to prove the convergence 
of this algorithm ``hinge primarily on the firmly nonexpansive properties of the resolvents". 
Inspired by this remark, the speaker, together with L. Leu&#351;tean and A. Nicolae, has introduced 
in [5] the notion of jointly firmly nonexpansive family of mappings, which allows for a highly 
abstract proof of the proximal point algorithm's convergence, encompassing virtually all known 
variants in the literature. We have recently revisited [6] the concept, providing a conceptual 
characterization of it and showing how it may be used to prove other kinds of results usually 
associated with resolvent-type mappings. In this talk, we shall report on all these findings 
and point towards works in progress and future developments.

On complexity of the first-order algorithms for convex optimization
<br><br>
Abstract: The potential of the first-order algorithms in the big data context has been confirmed
repeatedly in the last decades, in fields like machine learning, signal processing and computer science.
In this seminar we will introduce and analyze the main first-order methods successfully used to solve
many convex optimization models under various smoothness and convexity features.
Our analysis will provide insights on their iterative behaviour and iteration complexity for
deterministic and stochastic (noisy) settings. Finally, some concrete applications will be discussed.

Learning orthonormal dictionaries as efficient as the Fast Fourier Transform
<br><br>
Abstract: Dictionary learning is a popular technique in signal 
processing and machine learning used to build simple or efficient 
representations of data. In this talk, we will look at this problem when 
the dictionary we construct is constrained to be orthonormal. We discuss 
why is property is desirable and how to introduce additional properties 
such as numerical efficiency. The goal is to show how to learn 
transformations from data that are at least as efficient as the Fast 
Fourier Transform (FFT). We will discuss applications and extensions of 
this work.

About the use of B-spline functions in motion planning
<br><br>
Abstract:
B-spline functions are a popular choice for describing trajectories associated with nonlinear 
dynamics and for imposing continuous-time constraint validation. Exploiting their properties 
(local support, convexity and positivity) usually leads to sufficient conditions which are 
conservative. In this talk I will present two methods which reduce the conservatism: the 
first makes use of sum-of-squares polynomials to provide a linear matrix inequality-type 
formulation giving necessary and sufficient conditions and the second makes use of knot 
refinement strategies to improve arbitrarily -well on the sufficient conditions. In both 
cases, the approaches are validated for a motion planning problem where off-line trajectories 
with obstacle(s) avoidance guarantees are generated.
