On Representations of Intended Structures in Foundational Theories
<br><br>
Abstract: Often philosophers, logicians, and mathematicians employ a notion of intended 
structure when talking about a branch of mathematics. In addition, we know that there are 
foundational mathematical theories that can find representatives for the objects of informal 
mathematics. In this paper, we examine how faithfully foundational theories can represent 
intended structures, and show that this question is closely linked to the decidability of 
the theory of the intended structure. Joint work with Neil Barton and Moritz Muller.

<br>DELP: Dynamic Epistemic Logic for Security Protocols
<br><br>
Abstract: The formal analysis of security protocols is a challenging field, with various approaches 
being studied nowadays. The famous Burrows-Abadi-Needham Logic was the first logical system aiming to 
validate security protocols. Combining ideas from previous approaches,  in this paper we define a complete 
system of dynamic epistemic logic for modeling security protocols.  Our logic  is implemented, and few of 
its properties are verifyied, using the theorem prover Lean.

A Rewriting-based Toolset for Specification Processing
<br><br>
Abstract: We explore some of the features that promote term rewriting
and, in particular, Maude as a meta-language for working with logical
systems, and showcase a set of rewriting-based tools that support the
syntactic analysis and processing of formal specifications. Along the
way, we discuss basic aspects related to the development of
interpreters of specification languages, including user-interface
design, parsing specifications, and executing commands. All this is
done in a logic-agnostic manner, meaning that the techniques we
describe apply to a wide variety of logical formalisms. To illustrate
the approach, we introduce SpeX, a general platform for working with
formal specifications, and demonstrate the steps required for
integrating new logical formalisms within SpeX.

Inductive and Coinductive Reasoning with Isabelle/HOL
<br><br>
Abstract: I will describe basic and advanced mechanisms for inductive
and coinductive reasoning available in the interactive theorem prover
Isabelle/HOL. They cover inductive and coinductive predicates founded
on Knaster-Tarski fixed points, inductive and coinductive datatypes,
structural recursion and corecursion, corecursion "up-to" and mixed
recursion-corecursion. The concepts will be illustrated with examples
formalized in Isabelle, but they should be understandable to computer
scientists, logicians and mathematicians with no knowledge of
Isabelle.

Experimental Mathematics by Rewriting
<br><br>
Abstract: This talk is about how to support mathematical investigation and development through machine 
performed computational experiments. Its unique character lies in a computational method and its 
associated programming technique.  
This is based an extended form of model-theoretic rewriting which includes some powerful 
features such as non-determinism and rule-based programming. It is also universal in the sense 
that that it is applicable in principle to a wide variety of mathematical domains. Its solid and 
transparent mathematical and logical foundations lead to a programming experience that is very 
close to doing mathematics, which means it is much more suitable for mathematicians than other 
forms of do-it-yourself programming.  The talk will touch directly two aspects of this 
activity: model-theoretic foundations and case studies.

On extracting variable Herbrand disjunctions
<br><br>
Abstract: Some quantitative results obtained by proof mining take the form of Herbrand disjunctions 
that may depend on additional parameters. We attempt to elucidate this fact through an extension 
to first-order arithmetic of the proof of Herbrand's theorem due to Gerhardy and Kohlenbach which 
uses the functional interpretation. <br>

A short story on logics with typed modalities
<br><br>
Abstract: We introduce a family of modal logics aimed at modeling discrete evolutionary systems. 
These are extensions of ordinary equational and relational logics with typed modalities. 
Unlike the classical notion of modality, typed modalities have the advantage of keeping track 
of changes of system configurations. We employ inner types to capture triggers of changes and 
outer types to capture outcomes. As an example, we model the biological process of membrane 
budding. We discuss some implementation details and glance at connections with the theory of bigraphs.

<br>Verifying the Conversion into CNF in Dafny
<br><br>
Abstract: We present two computer-verified implementations of the CNF conversion for propositional logic. 
The two implementations are fully verified: functional correctness and termination is machine-checked 
using the Dafny language for both. The first approach is based on repeatedly applying a set of 
equivalences and is often presented in logic textbooks. The second approach is based on Tseitinâs 
transformation and is more efficient. We present the main ideas behind our formalization and we 
discuss the main difficulties in verifying the two algorithms.<br><br>

<br>Halpern and Mann iterative schemas: A path towards generalization
<br><br>
Abstract: In this talk I shall discuss recent joint work with Bruno Dinis, where we considered an 
iterative schema which alternates between Halpern and Krasnoselskii-Mann style iterations. We prove, 
under suitable conditions, the strong convergence of this algorithm in the general nonlinear setting 
of CAT(0) spaces. Besides obtaining quantitative information, we will see how such a proof was 
made possible by techniques and ideas from the proof mining program. Our results generalize recent 
work by Bo&#539;, Csetnek and Meier, and Cheval and Leu&#351;tean.

Modal frame incompleteness. An account through second order logic
<br><br>
Abstract: Propositional modal logic is usually viewed as a generalization and extension of 
propositional classical logic. The main argument of this paper is that a good case can be made 
that modal logic should be construed as a restricted form of second order classical logic. 
The paper makes use of the embedding of modal logic in second order logic and henceforth it 
goes on examining one aspect of this second order connection having to do with an incompleteness 
phenomenon. The leading concept is that modal incompleteness is to be explained as a kind of 
exemplification of standard order incompleteness. More- over the modal incompleteness phenomenon 
is essentially rooted in the weaker expressive power of the language of sentential modal logic 
as compared to the stronger expressive power of the language of second order logic.

Notes on abundant elements in union-closed sets
<br><br>
Abstract:  In this presentation we explore an elementary problem, posed by Peter Frankel in 1979, a problem that is still open.
The main attraction of the problem resides in its simple formulation: any finite union-closed family of sets ${\mathcal A}$ has an element 
that is contained in at least half of the member-sets. A family ${\mathcal A}$ of sets is union-closed if for every two member-sets 
$A_1$, $A_2$ from ${\mathcal A}$, the union is also contained in ${\mathcal A}$.

Theoretical developments on many-sorted modal logic
<br><br>
Abstract: This presentation aims to introduce many-sorted generalizations of bisimulations. 
We prove that the disjoint unions, generated submodels and bounded morphisms are all special 
cases of bisimulation, we show that bisimilarity implies modal equivalence, and examine a 
special case in which the converse is valid. We also introduce the generalization for finite 
models and we prove the analogue of Filtration Theorem.

Lean4 implementation of Weakly Extensional Heyting Arithmetic
<br><br>
Abstract: In this talk we will start by discussing about the main ideas introduced in the Lean4 
theorem prover, that helps us to formalize various subjects commonly approached in mathematics. 
Further, in a pragmatic way, we will briefly illustrate some use cases of this proof assistant 
that will strengthen the ideas discussed previously. Finally, as a base for future integration of 
proof mining techniques in Lean4, we will present our implementation of the logical system use 
in proof mining, weakly extensional Heyting arithmetic in all finite types, and show some difference 
between its definitions and actual implementation of them.

Åukasiewicz Logic and Neural Networks
<br><br>
Abstract: We show that a particular class of multilayer perceptrons, which describes possibly 
non-linear phenomena is linked with Åukasiewicz logic.  We will describe how we
can name a neural network with a formula and, viceversa, how we can associate a class of 
neural networks to each formula. Moreover, we introduce the definition of Åukasiewicz Equivalent 
Neural Networks to stress the strong connection between different neural networks via Åukasiewicz 
logical objects. More in general,  we can say that starting from a syntax, plus a logic, plus
Universal Algebra we get: 
<br>
(â¢) a symbolic representation of classes of neural networks 
<br>
(â¢) a pillar of a bridge between a logical calculus and Neural Networks. 
<br>
This seems to be a paradigm that can be used in many different ways.

Towards Game-Theoretic Models of Moral and Other-Regarding Agents
<br><br>
Abstract: In the first part of the talk I will discuss the need for
the development of a logic-based specification formalism for
decision-theoretic and game-theoretic concepts, ultimately resulting
in a software library for decision and game theory. I will outline
some requirements for such a library including
<ul>
<li>cognitive plausibility </li>
<li>expresiveness</li>
<li>tractability</li>
</ul>
and the constraints such requirements pose on the underlying logic formalisms.

In the second part of the talk (based on a paper presented at TARK 2021, see
<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2106.10886">https://arxiv.org/html/2106.10886</a>) I will discuss Kantian equilibria
in finite normal form games, a class of non-Nashian, morally motivated
courses of action that was recently proposed in the economics
literature.

I will highlight a number of problems with such equilibria, including
computational intractability, a high price of miscoordination, and
problematic extension to general normal form games. I give such a
generalization based on concept of program equilibria, and point out
that that a practically relevant generalization may not exist. To
remedy this I will propose some general, intuitive, computationally
tractable, other-regarding equilibria that are special cases Kantian
equilibria, as well as a class of courses of action that interpolates
between purely self-regarding and Kantian behavior.

Kripke Semantics for Intuitionistic Åukasiewicz Logic
<br><br>
Abstract:  This paper proposes a generalization of the Kripke semantics of intuitionistic 
logic $\mathbf{IL}$ appropriate for intuitionistic Åukasiewicz logic $\mathbf{IÅL}$ â a logic in 
the intersection between $\mathbf{IL}$ and (classical) 
Åukasiewicz logic. This generalised Kripke semantics is based on the poset sum construction, 
used in Bova and Montagna (Theoret Comput Sci 410(12):1143â1158, 2009) to show the decidability 
(and PSPACE completeness) of the quasiequational theory of commutative, integral and bounded 
GBL algebras. The main idea is that $w \Vdash \psi$âwhich for $\mathbf{IÅL}$ is a relation 
between worlds $w$ and formulas $\psi$, and can be seen as a function taking values in 
the booleans $(w \Vdash \psi ) \in {{\mathbb {B}}}$âbecomes a function taking values in 
the unit interval $(w \Vdash \psi ) \in [0,1]$. 
An appropriate monotonicity restriction (which we call sloping functions) needs to be put on 
such functions in order to ensure soundness and completeness of the semantics.

A Real-Valued Modal Logic
<br><br>
Abstract:  Two core families of many-valued modal logics emerge: order-based modal logics, including modal 
extensions of GÃ¶del logics, where only the order type of the truth values matters, and continuous 
modal logics, such as those based on Åukasiewicz logic where propositional connectives are 
interpreted by continuous functions over sets of real numbers. In this talk we focus on continuous many-valued modal logics. 
<br>
Abelian logic was introduced independently by Meyer and Slaney [1] as a relevant logic, and 
Casari [2] as a comparative logic. We show that continuous many-valued modal logic corresponds 
to a fragment of a minimal modal extension of Abelian logic K(A) [3,4]. 
<br>
We present a sound and complete labelled tableau calculus for K(A) and obtain a coNEXPTIME 
upper bound for checking validity in this logic. For the more manageable modal-multiplicative 
fragment of K(A) we give an EXPTIME upper bound for checking validity and establish the completeness 
of an analytic sequent calculus and an axiomatisation system that, unlike other such systems for
 continuous many-valued modal logic, has only finitary rules.

Scheme-Based Algorithm Synthesis by Lazy Thinking (a retrospective)
<br><br>
Abstract: Lazy Thinking is a deductive, scheme-based synthesis method, proposed by Bruno 
Buchberger as part of a mathematical theory exploration model and implemented to some extent 
in the Theorema system.
<br>
Lazy Thinking works as follows: a proof of the correctness of an algorithm (i.e. its specification) 
using an algorithm scheme and using complete knowledge about the specification is attempted. 
All definitions and properties 
of concepts involved in the specifications are known. The proof is likely to fail, as no 
information about the unknown subalgorithms is available. Following an analysis of the failing proof, 
conjectures are generated and added to the knowledge, such that the failure can be overcome. 
These conjectures turn out to be specifications for the unknown subalgorithms. Algorithms that 
satisfy the generated specifications can then either be retrieved from the knowledge base, or 
synthesized by lazy thinking in subsequent rounds of exploration.
<br>
We give some examples of scheme-based theory exploration, including the synthesis of a Groebner 
Bases algorithm. 
We will also give some remarks on potential developments of the ideas presented here.

On the parameterized complexity of $\Delta_0$ truth 
<br><br>
Abstract:  We consider the problem, given a $\Delta_0$ formula $\varphi(x)$ and a natural 
number $n$ in unary, whether $\varphi(n)$ is true. We are interested in instances of the problem 
where n is much bigger than $\varphi$. More precisely, we consider the parameterized problem with 
parameter $|\varphi|$. We show unconditionally that this problem does not belong to the parameterized 
version of $AC^0$. We also show that certain natural {\em upper bounds} on the parameterized complexity 
of the problem imply separations of classical complexity classes. These results are obtained by 
an analysis of a parameterized halting problem. A related problem concerns the provability 
of the MRDP theorem in bounded arithmetic.

Deductive synthesis of sorting algorithms on lists and on binary trees in Theorema
<br><br>
Abstract:  This talk presents recent results published in ICTAC'21 and JLAMP'21.
We describe the principles and the implementation of AlCons (Algorithm Constructor), a system 
for the automatic proof--based synthesis of sorting algorithms on lists and on binary trees, 
in the frame of the Theorema system. The core of the system is a dedicated prover based on 
specific inference rules and strategies for constructive proofs over the domains of lists 
and of binary trees, aimed at the automatic synthesis of sorting algorithms and their auxiliary 
functions from logical specifications. The specific distinctive feature of our approach is 
the use of multisets for expressing the fact that two lists (trees) have the same elements. 
This allows a more natural expression of the properties related to sorting, compared to the 
classical approach using the permutation relation (a list is a permutation of another). Moreover, 
the use of multisets leads to special inference rules and strategies which make the proofs 
more efficient, as for instance: expand/compress multiset terms and solve meta-variables using 
multiset equalities. Additionally, we use a Noetherian induction strategy based on the relation 
induced by the strict inclusion of multisets, which facilitates the synthesis of arbitrary recursion 
structures, without having to indicate the recursion schemes in advance. The necessary auxiliary 
algorithms (like, e.g., for insertion and merging) are generated by the same principles from 
the synthesis conjectures that are automatically produced during the main proof, using a ``cascading" 
method, which in fact contributes to the automation of theory exploration. The prover is 
implemented in the frame of the Theorema system and works in natural style, while the 
generated algorithms can be immediately tested in the same system.

Non Archimedean Random Variables and Åukasiewicz Logics
<br><br>
Abstract:  First Rota's problem is an informal problem on how reformulate probability without making 
appeal to sets of points like the sample space. In particular Rota calls for ``algebras of random variables".
The pointfree approach of Mundici is in terms of "algebras of random variables" in the sense of Nelson. 
This means that one uses a category of rings or algebraic structures ($C^*$-algebras in this case) which is 
equivalent to the categories of interest. <br>
Indeed,  Mundici mentions the possibility of treating probability in MV-algebras with infinitesimals.  
Our main aim is to show that such a development is indeed possible and to extend Mundici's results to 
non-archimedean random variables. We also will show that algebras of non archimedean random variables are 
models of an extension of Åukasiewicz logic.

Region Types for Region-based Memory Management
<br><br>
Abstract:  Region-based memory management is an old idea of heap memory management. In this talk, 
we present our results on the use of region type systems to ensure the safe use of regions. 
We also discuss our ongoing work on applying regions to the Rust language.

Reasoning by brute force. Implementing a natural deduction proof calculator with minimal heuristics
<br><br>
Abstract:  One result of the `Logic and software' elective course held in 2022 at the Faculty of Philosophy, 
University of Bucharest was the interactive development of a natural deduction calculator that successfully 
proves propositional exercises in classical textbooks. The calculator has versions in Python and PHP, both 
common programming languages, allowing the easy study and change of the software code corresponding to NK rules. 
It also uses brute force - running all allowable rules until the conclusion is adequately derived, 
then retracing the steps to display the shortest path to it; no human-like rules-of-thumb or backwards 
reasoning were used. Since computational complexity required speed optimizations, a demonstration 
of their soundness and completeness is sketched.

Dedukti, a standard language for the interoperability of proof systems
<br><br>
<a href="https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti">Dedukti</a> is a logical framework to encode 
various logics to allow interoperability of proofs between different formal tools, like Coq, PVS or Isabelle. 
This logical framework is based on $\lambda\Pi$-calculus modulo theory, a $\lambda$-calculus 
with dependent types, and extended with rewriting rules.
After a presentation of the $\lambda\Pi$-calculus modulo theory, I will talk about translations 
to Dedukti, as well as interoperability challenges.
Finally, I will mention other work done by <a href="https://deducteam.gitlabpages.inria.fr/">Deducteam</a>.

On the Expressiveness of a Logic of Separated Relations
<br><br>
Abstract: We compare the model-theoretic expressiveness of the existential fragment of Separation 
Logic over unrestricted relational signatures (SLR)  with only separating conjunction as 
logical connective and higher-order inductive definitions, traditionally known as the symbolic 
heap fragment, with (Monadic) Second Order Logic ((M)SO). While SLR and MSO are incomparable on 
structures of unbounded treewidth, it turns out that SLR can be embedded in SO, in general, 
and that MSO becomes a strict subset of SLR, when the treewidth of the models is bounded by 
a parameter given as input. We also discuss the problem of defining a fragment of SLR that 
is equivalent to MSO over models of bounded treewidth. Such a fragment would then become 
the most general Separation Logic with a decidable entailment problem, a key ingredient of 
practical verification methods for self-adapting (reconfigurable) component-based and distributed systems.
